# Motor Detection
DC motor efficiency detection using Oscilloscope and DC supply
This project is to detect DC motor quality by observing its working using matplotlib.pyplot to plot graph received from oscilloscope.
    
This project is created for NSC(National Software Contest) 2022.

## MainGUI contains
1. Motor rotation graph
2. Oscilloscope control panel
3. DC supply control panel
